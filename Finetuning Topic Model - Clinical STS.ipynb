    "#### What is topic coherence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is coherence?\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of statements or facts is said to be coherent, if they support each other. Thus, a coherent fact set can be interpreted in a context that covers all or most of the facts. An example of a coherent fact set is \"the game is a team sport\", \"the game is played with a ball\", \"the game demands great physical efforts\"\n",

    "2. `C_p` is based on a sliding window, one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelson's coherence\n",
    "3. `C_uci` measure is based on a sliding window and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the given top words\n",
    "4. `C_umass` is based on document cooccurrence counts, a one-preceding segmentation and a logarithmic conditional probability as confirmation measure\n",
    "5. `C_npmi` is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI)\n",
    "6. `C_a` is baseed on a context window, a pairwise comparison of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity"
